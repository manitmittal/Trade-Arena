Stock Market in India has seen a very good adoption rate since we entered the Bullish Phase after the Covid Market Crash, a lot of first time traders and investors are flocking to market with high hopes. Hopes to make quick cash, but trading is one such profession where making easy money is very difficult. Since we will be working on Groww's Problem Statement to Revolutionize Investments in India, we want to solve a major problem for them. That is the dependency of revenues of a brokerage firm on the market performance, it has been observed that the profits in the broking industries are directly proportional to the growth rate of market index, we want to solve this problem by intoducing a platform where users could first practice and learn trading, hone the skills and then get to the brokers with real money and start investing. TradeArena will be a very Simple yet Nimble Idea to make the conventional Stock Market Trading Competitive. All the team members of the revered TeamOne are competitive coders and have been doing that for quite some time now. Two of the members have been trading actively in the Indian Stock Market, when solving problems on HackerRank our main motivation came by seeing that my friend had more points than me and Iâ€™ll have to pull an all-nighter to surpass him, this is the one thing that we always missed in the trading domain. Hence we decided to make a simulator where we can conduct competitive trading leagues and maintain a healthy competition and along with competitive Trading we could learn from each other's trading strategies.
